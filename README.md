# CT-FM
CT-FM (Cell Type Fine-Mapping) pipeline

CT-FM is a statistical genetics method to identify causal cell types underlying diseases and complex traits. We leverage cell type specific candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) together with GWAS summary statistics while accounting for co-regulation of cis-regulatory effects across diverse cell types.
